# TeXPad
Welcome to TeXPad, my attempt at testing out AutoHotkey by turning generic numpad into LaTeX shortcuts (designed with Overleaf in mind).

## The Changes
Below is a diagram illustrating the actual key-mapping changes from the normal numpad to TeXPad.

In the diagram above, 'T' denotes the text function \textrm, and the rest are their relevant LaTeX commands.

## Installation
The first, most important step is to **install AutoHotKey**. To do so, visit the [AutoHotKey main page](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and download the relevant version.
Secondly, run the script `latex.ahk` or `latex-rottay.ahk` stored in this repository!

## Keys
The easiest way to change your keycaps are with stickers. This can be acheived by handwriting on a set of stickers (or Post-It notes), or using a labelmaker for a uniform font. If you want to change the keycaps entirely as I did, I used Thingiverse to find the correct keycap, and printed it using transparent PLA, before adding a sticker via labelmaker.
