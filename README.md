# TeXPad
Welcome to TeXPad, my attempt at testing out AutoHotkey by turning generic numpad into LaTeX shortcuts (designed with Overleaf in mind).

## The Changes
Below is a diagram illustrating the actual key-mapping changes from the normal numpad to TeXPad.

In the diagram above, 'T' denotes the text function \textrm, and the rest are their relevant LaTeX commands.

## Installation
The first, most important step is to **install AutoHotKey**. To do so, visit the [AutoHotKey main page](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and download the relevant version.
Secondly, run the script `latex.ahk` stored in this repository!

## Keys
Currently, stickers are probably the easiest way to change the keycaps on your numpad to fit TeXPad. However, hopefullly there will be STL files for keycaps in the near future!
